State/Context + Intersection:
The obstacles uses state/context as well as intersection to check positions relative to the player.

Interpolation:
The player uses interpolation for its movement.

Collision:
The Collision - classes (in the collision folder) is used to experiment with collision.

Noise:
Initially I tried to generate a mesh using noise, but couldn't help copying a lot from the lecture material.
I ended up using noise in the obstacle manager to randomize the spawning of the obstacles.
